  <h3>"Four Hugs A Day"</h3>
  <p>Family therapist Virginia Satir once said, <b>‚ÄúWe need four hugs a day for survival. We need 8 hugs a day for maintenance. We need 12 hugs a day for growth.‚Äù</b> Satir explains that in order to get by in life, humans require multiple genuine interactions with one another every day. Such a world would be nice. However, with the rise of social media as many individuals‚Äô primary form of communication, the reality is that we have sacrificed the number of interactions we have with others with the quality of each interaction.</p>
  <p>To combat this a couple acquaintances and I decided to build a social media application that encourages more meaningful and genuine interactions between one another. We came up with this idea during the peak of the covid pandemic, where pretty much all face to face interactions were replaced with digital ones. This made it all the more relevant to figure out a way to preserve the fulfilling feeling of having an in person conversation with someone through social media.</p>
  <p>For this project I was the UI/UX lead for our project, as was tasked with leading the design of our frontend components, as well as leading the development of our application client in React Native.</p>

      There is a tradeoff...
    </h3>
    <div class="item-right">
      <p>...between the convenience of one-step interactions (like the pressing of a like button or sending a short message), and the authenticity and depth of the interaction. Authentic and genuine interactions take time and effort, which is not always something that people are in the mood for.</p>
      <p>The question for us was how to create a social platform that helps users put more thought and emotion into the messages they send others <b>without</b> making it inconvenient for them to send a message, or make the user feel forced into participating. </p>
      <p>We aimed to tackle this by implementing a messaging platform where users send each other what we coined as <b>‚ÄúDigital Hugs‚Äù</b>, keeping in line with the four hugs a day quote mentioned earlier. We set out to find out how we could enforce meaningful interactions by sending hugs to one another. </p>

  <h3>Our User Reseach Showed Us...</h3>
  <p>...that people are indeed willing to put in the extra effort to better communicate digitally with their friends. Snapchat was by far the most mentioned service for both message encouragement and authenticity. With this info our team began drawing inspiration from existing social media platforms and went about creating these user stories:</p>

    <h3 class="item-left">Our Main Features</h3>
    <div class="item-left">
      <h4>Digital Hugs</h4>
      <p>Our primary feature. In order to chat with another user, a hug must be sent. A hug is like any regular text message, however all initial hugs are sent in response to a randomly selected prompt. Furthermore, hugs have a 20 word minimum, ensuring that messages sent have enough content to spark a decent conversation. Once a hug is sent, the receiving user can opt to either accept or reject the hug. When the user accepts a hug they are required to send a message back (without the prompt or word minimum requirement of the initial hug message). When a hug is accepted and sent back, users are then able to freely message each other like in any other messaging platform. If a hug is rejected, the receiver does not send a hug back, although the sender is not notified of the rejection.</p>

    <div class="item-left">
      <h4>Keep In Touch Friends List</h4>
      <p>In order to encourage users to reach out to different people and maintain a healthy and diverse social circle, the friends list is not ordered by most recent interactions, rather the opposite. Friends you have not reached out to for a while will be displayed at the top of the friends list, and friends you have just messaged will be at the bottom of your friends list. This provides users the opportunity to easily access and contact friends that they have not spoken to in a while.</p>

    <img class="item-right medium inline" src="/assets/images/fouro/fouro-icon-friends.png"/>
  </div>
  <div class="content-right">
    <div class="item-left">
      <h4>Four Hugs A Day Streak</h4>
      <p>Through our user research we found that users are most motivated to send messages to each other when they have some sort of incentive/track record to protect. Much like snapchat streaks, we implemented our own streak feature that keeps track of how many hugs a user has sent in a single day, as well as the number of days the user has sent and received 4 or more hugs (again keeping in line with the 4 hugs a day idea).</p>

  <h3>To Start Out Our Technical Design...</h3>
  <p>...we got to work on building out the technical parts of our application including our tech stack, backend structure, api structure, frontend pages and frontend components. Being the first time I‚Äôve ever worked on a full frontend to backend application, this was a very helpful experience that allowed me to understand the end-to-end data lifecycle between the front and backend of our application.</p>
  <h4>For our frontend...</h4>
  <p>... we used react native and created a spreadsheet of frontend components and assigned each component to various group members.</p>
  <img src="/assets/images/fouro/fouro-frontend-components.png" class="small"/>
  <h4>For our backend...</h4>
  <p>...we used a nosql database hosted by firebase, and designed a schema that detailed our db structure. We also created a spreadsheet listing out all of our server endpoints so we could start modeling our frontend requests.</p>

  <h3>Our Prototyping Process...</h3>
  <p>Involved creating multiple designs on Figma and reviewing them as a group. Our main focus here was to ensure every main feature was only 1-2 user actions away at any given point. We wanted every interactive component to stand out as something that could be interacted with, without having our components deviate from the overall style of our app too much.</p>
  <img src="/assets/images/fouro/fouro-prototyping.png" class="large"/>

<section>
  <h3>App Development</h3>
  <p>Through react native, I had the opportunity to work extensively with component based frameworks. Our group drew on several component libraries that gave me experience working with 3rd party code bases and apis. To power and test our frontend work we used expo, which we had our qualms with but ended up figuring it out in the end.</p>
  <p>Through the whole process we worked closely with our backend team to ensure our frontend was being developed to match our backend apis, which led to a smooth process of hooking up our frontend with our backend. I had already had some experience with developing and using web based apis, so I was able to help out my team a lot during this process.</p>
</section>
<hr>
<section class="content-center">
  <h3>For Our Final Design...</h3>
  <p>...we wanted to keep all related actions and information on the same pages. For example, user search is accessible within the friends page, so the user doesn't need to perform extra navigations to reach the user search. Keeping related items on the same page also helps the user get familiar with the UI faster than if navigation routes were scattered throughout our app without any real pattern.</p>
  <h4>Onboarding & Login</h4>
  <img src="/assets/images/fouro/fouro-wireframe-onboarding.png" class="small"/>
  <p>One feature we included in the onboarding process was a small survey section for further user testing. Users also have the ability to set a hug count goal that will be counted in the streaks feature alongside the standard 4 hugs a day for each user.</p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <h4>Home Page</h4>
  <img src="/assets/images/fouro/fouro-wireframe-home.png" class="large"/>
  <p>The home page features a feed of all your current and past hug exchanges. These contain the iniital hug exchange along with any other messages sent in the hug exchange, so that users can remember the interactions and conversations they had with their friends.</p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <h4>Friends Page</h4>
  <img src="/assets/images/fouro/fouro-wireframe-friends.png" class="large"/>
  <p>The friends list implements the bubble up feature, so the friends a user has not messages for the longest will be featured at the top of the list. You can also search for users by name/username from the friends page as well</p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <h4>Send a Hug</h4>
  <img src="/assets/images/fouro/fouro-wireframe-hug.png" class="large"/>
  <p>The send hug feature is the same as discussed earlier. Since we want to encourage users to send hugs, we made it easy to do just that. The send hug workflow can be entered from pretty much any page within our application, making it easy to initiate a hug exchange.</p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <h4>Notifications</h4>
  <img src="/assets/images/fouro/fouro-wireframe-notifications.png" class="large"/>
  <p>We wanted to make our notifications page match the look and feel of most standard mobile UI notification screen so that users would feel at home in our application. Users can send a hug back from this page, or drop any hugs they don't want to respond to.</p>

  <h3>In Retrospect...</h3>
  <p>...this was an extremely eye opening process for me. Like I mentioned before this was the first full-stack application project I had ever worked on. I learned the value that comes from creating a design blueprint beforehand. Without our preplanning and organization of our features, we would not have even come close to a finished product.</p>
  <h4>Design Retrospective</h4>
  <p><b>From a purely design aspect,</b> I realized that design is not only limited to graphics and UIs, rather it encompasses everything under the umbrella of user experience. We had a goal to create a user experience where users could have meaningfull conversations with their friends without having to put too much effort into curating an authentic message. While this experience is not visual, we still had to design features that would allow the users to experience the feeling we wanted them to. Designing our hugs, keep in touch, and streaks features was more like solving a puzzle to trick the human brain, as opposed to creating a UI with graphics that looked cool. This project fully changed my understanding of what it means to be a designer.</p>
  <p>I think that if I were to change anything, I would have done more to create a design system/UI kit before actually having our team design the individual screens and features. In our project we kind of just went ahead with designing each screen, giving us some obvious design conflicts and mismatches. We also struggled with keeping our component sizing consistent across different devices, which was an obstacle we didn't pay much attention to until we absolutely had to. A big mistake on our part that took a ton of time to remedy</p>
  <h4>Technical Retrospective</h4>
  <p>It's hard to say that I would change our tools for frontend development, since I had very little experience at the time working with mobile frontend applications, but I can say for sure that trying to build a cross platform application is not easy stuff. Furthermore trying to work with expo and React Native was something of a nightmare. <b>However,</b> through this process I was able to see a lot of patterns in how frontend systems work, and I was able to abstract a lot of those patterns myself by the end of our project. If I were to go back and recode with the knowledge I have now, our application would be far more efficient, organized, and robust.</p>
  <p>So yeah, since I learned so much the first time around, I wouldn't have changed the way we went about the technical development of our project. Now, if I were to go and rebuild this application right now, I would definitely change many things.</p> 
  <p>For starters I would make this application either web based, or android only. I think react is a nice tool, but the React Native development environment is not yet suited to really be a solid candidate for mobile development in terms of developer expereince. I also think that using React Native kept me from learning a lot of the ins and outs of mobile development. Instead it just shoved a layer of tag based abstraction over the mobile environment.</p>
