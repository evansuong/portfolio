  <h3>"Four Hugs A Day"</h3>
  <p>Family therapist Virginia Satir once said, <b>“We need four hugs a day for survival. We need 8 hugs a day for maintenance. We need 12 hugs a day for growth.”</b> Satir explains that in order to get by in life, humans require multiple genuine interactions with one another every day. Such a world would be nice. However, with the rise of social media as many individuals’ primary form of communication, the reality is that we have sacrificed the number of interactions we have with others with the quality of each interaction.</p>
  <p>To combat this a couple acquaintances and I decided to build a social media application that encourages more meaningful and genuine interactions between one another. We came up with this idea during the peak of the covid pandemic, where pretty much all face to face interactions were replaced with digital ones. This made it all the more relevant to figure out a way to preserve the fulfilling feeling of having an in person conversation with someone through social media.</p>

      There is a tradeoff...
    </h3>
    <div class="item-right">
      <p>...between the convenience of one-step interactions (like the pressing of a like button or sending a short message), and the authenticity and depth of the interaction. Authentic and genuine interactions take time and effort, which is not always something that people are in the mood for.</p>
      <p>The question for us was how to create a social platform that helps users put more thought and emotion into the messages they send others <b>without</b> making it inconvenient for them to send a message, or make the user feel forced into participating. </p>
      <p>We aimed to tackle this by implementing a messaging platform where users send each other what we coined as <b>“Digital Hugs”</b>, keeping in line with the four hugs a day quote mentioned earlier. We set out to find out how we could enforce meaningful interactions by sending hugs to one another. </p>

  <h3>Our User Reseach Showed Us...</h3>
  <p>...that people are indeed willing to put in the extra effort to better communicate digitally with their friends. Snapchat was by far the most mentioned service for both message encouragement and authenticity. With this info our team began drawing inspiration from existing social media platforms and went about creating these user stories:</p>

      <p>Makise</p>

    <h3 class="item-left">Our Main Features</h3>
    <div class="item-left">
      <h4>Digital Hugs</h4>
      <p>Our primary feature. In order to chat with another user, a hug must be sent. A hug is like any regular text message, however all initial hugs are sent in response to a randomly selected prompt. Furthermore, hugs have a 20 word minimum, ensuring that messages sent have enough content to spark a decent conversation. Once a hug is sent, the receiving user can opt to either accept or reject the hug. When the user accepts a hug they are required to send a message back (without the prompt or word minimum requirement of the initial hug message). When a hug is accepted and sent back, users are then able to freely message each other like in any other messaging platform. If a hug is rejected, the receiver does not send a hug back, although the sender is not notified of the rejection.</p>

    <img class="item-right medium" src="/assets/images/fouro/fouro-icon-hug.png"/>
  </div>
  <div class="content-right">
    <div class="item-left">
      <h4>Keep In Touch Friends List</h4>
      <p>In order to encourage users to reach out to different people and maintain a healthy and diverse social circle, the friends list is not ordered by most recent interactions, rather the opposite. Friends you have not reached out to for a while will be displayed at the top of the friends list, and friends you have just messaged will be at the bottom of your friends list. This provides users the opportunity to easily access and contact friends that they have not spoken to in a while.</p>
    </div>
    <img class="item-right medium" src="/assets/images/fouro/fouro-icon-friends.png"/>
  </div>
  <div class="content-right">
    <div class="item-left">
      <h4>Four Hugs A Day Streak</h4>
      <p>Through our user research we found that users are most motivated to send messages to each other when they have some sort of incentive/track record to protect. Much like snapchat streaks, we implemented our own streak feature that keeps track of how many hugs a user has sent in a single day, as well as the number of days the user has sent and received 4 or more hugs (again keeping in line with the 4 hugs a day idea).</p>

  <h3>To Start Out Our Technical Design...</h3>
  <p>...we got to work on building out the technical parts of our application including our tech stack, backend structure, api structure, frontend pages and frontend components. Being the first time I’ve ever worked on a full frontend to backend application, this was a very helpful experience that allowed me to understand the end-to-end data lifecycle between the front and backend of our application.</p>
  <h4>For our frontend...</h4>
  <p>... we used react native and created a spreadsheet of frontend components and assigned each component to various group members.</p>
  <img src="/assets/images/fouro/fouro-frontend-components.png" class="small"/>
  <h4>For our backend...</h4>
  <p>...we used a nosql database hosted by firebase, and designed a schema that detailed our db structure. We also created a spreadsheet listing out all of our server endpoints so we could start modeling our frontend requests.</p>

<section class="content-center">
  <h3>Our Prototyping Process...</h3>
  <p>Involved creating multiple designs on Figma and reviewing them as a group. Our main focus here was to ensure every main feature was only 1-2 user actions away at any given point. We wanted every interactive component to stand out as something that could be interacted with, without having our components deviate from the overall style of our app too much.</p>

  <h3>In Retrospect...</h3>
  <p>...this was an extremely eye opening process for me. Like I mentioned before this was the first full-stack application project I had ever worked on. I learned the value that comes from creating a design blueprint beforehand. Without our preplanning and organization of our features, we would not have even come close to a finished product.</p>
  <p><b>From a purely design aspect,</b> I realized that design is not only limited to graphics and UIs, rather it encompasses everything under the umbrella of user experience. We had a goal to create a user experience where users could have meaningfull conversations with their friends without having to put too much effort into curating an authentic message. While this experience is not visual, we still had to design features that would allow the users to experience the feeling we wanted them to. Designing our hugs, keep in touch, and streaks features was more like solving a puzzle to trick the human brain, as opposed to creating a UI with graphics that looked cool. This project fully changed my understanding of what it means to be a designer.</p>

      <p>People fill their social media with various screenshots from Spotify and Apple Music to show off the music that they currently listen to. Whether we like it or not, the music we listen to is tied to our identity as people, which we have learned to use to build relationships with others and discuss the music that we’re passionate about.</p>

  <h3>Going Into This Project...</h3>
  <p>...I had no formal experience in graphic design. I was initially tasked with frontend dev, but I was really eager to open myself up to the world of design. Thanks to the help of some fellow team members who did have some basic design experience, we curated a roadmap that we could follow to get to a final design.</p>

  <h3>Brand Design</h3>
  <p>We worked first on a color palette, followed by some landing page concepts</p>
  <img src="/assets/images/muse/muse-colors.png" class="large" alt="a list of all the colors we included in our brand color pallette"/>
  <p>We chose to experiment on our advertisement/landing page since we would publish it before the application itself. It also gave us a good canvas to curate a solid set of brand icons and graphics that we would use in our application.</p>
  <ul class="icon-list">
    <li>

        <figcaption><b>We started here:</b></figcaption>

  <h3>We Proceeded With Our Prototyping By...</h3>
  <div class="content-right">
    <div class="content-center">
      <p class="skinny">...starting with this design. We ran through a few iterations of our mobile app designs, getting user feedback after each redesign.</p>
      <p class="skinny">We didn't like using the colored background to distinguish different UI sections, as it seemed to guide user attention to the sections with colored background, while also causing a noticeable break in each page. We also found that we could rearrange the layout in a more efficient and clean way...</p>
    </div>
    <img src="/assets/images/muse/muse-prototype-old.png" class="medium"/>
  </div>
  <div class="content-left">
    <img src="/assets/images/muse/muse-prototype-new.png" class="medium"/>
    <div class="content-center">
      <p class="skinny">...so for our final iteration we implemented shaded section backgrounds, along with some clever layout sizing.</p>
      <p class="skinny">We ended up with this design, which we feel provided an interface that was easy to use, understand, and looked good. The navbar at the bottom was a nice touch, since we were able to have a new take on an existing popular design</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Our Final Design...</h3>
  <div class="content-left">
    <img class="item-left large" src="assets/images/muse/muse-page-harmonize.png"/>
    <div class="item-right">
      <h4>Harmonize Page</h4>
      <p>This is the central feature to our design. The Harmonize feature allows users to compare their music listening habits with another user of their choice. To do this we pulled listening history data from both user's Spotify accounts and perform some machine learning magic to calculate how similar these listning habits are</p>
      <p>The UI design for this feature was pretty simple. We wanted the compatibility score to be the center of the user's attention on this page. We also wanted to give the user a follow up action to the harmonize process, allowing them to view the compared user's profile without having to perform any extra navigation.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="content-left">
    <img class="item-left large" src="assets/images/muse/muse-page-explore.png"/>
    <div class="item-right">
      <h4>Explore Page</h4>
      <p>The explore page was designed to support our other two features: Music Exploration and User Exploration. Although these weren't part of the MVP, our group wanted a full application design in order to have a full design set up for those interested in getting involved with our project.</p>
      <p>Like the earlier prototypes, we gave the sections individual shaded backgrounds so users could better distinguish different sections of content from one another.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="content-left">
    <img class="item-left large" src="assets/images/muse/muse-page-profile.png"/>
    <div class="item-right">
      <h4>Profile Page</h4>
      <p>For our users' profiles, we emphasized on identifying data. Just like someone's Tinder profile is their individual outward identity to the Tinder community, our users' Muse profiles should have the same effect.</p>
      <p>Users should be able to get a good idea of the type of music listener you are just by reading your profile. That was the goal here.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="content-left">
    <img class="item-left medium" src="assets/images/muse/muse-page-feed.png"/>
    <div class="item-right">
      <h4>General Feed</h4>
      <p>This feature was also not part of our MVP, but had a design completed for it.</p>
      <p>Like the explore page, this feature was intended to help users meet new people and explore new music, but by directly showing users what kind of music their friends were listening to. We wanted each feed item to stand out, like every music discovery a friend made was significant. We intended for this to promote users to look into their friends actions to help them find new music and meet new people. (You can see a repeating theme here)</p>

<section>
  <h3>BUT... DESPITE OUR BEST EFFORTS, MUSE NEVER CAME TO BE. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHY</h3>
</section>
<hr>
<section>
  <h3>In Retrospect...</h3>
  <p>...there are a ton of things I would do differently, which is undestandable given that this was my first semi-formal design project. Far too many of our team's decisions were based on our own opinions that led us to dead-ends and impossible tasks. We failed in many areas to introduce contraints with both our designs and applciation features, which was the main contributor to us not being able to finish and publish our application.</p>
  <h4>User Research and User Testing</h4>
  <p>The issue was not the quantity of our user testing, but the quality of it. After our user research and user testing, we didn't have a super clear direction in front of us. To put it another way, our user research and testing were not very forward thinking, and felt more like we were just going through the motions here.</p>
  <p>Instead, I would've put more effort into figuring out the questions we wanted answered by our rounds of user research, and designing our research and testing methods to allow users to answer those questions for us.</p>
  <h4>Prototyping</h4>
  <p>This was an error in timing and prioritizing. I think our team got caught up in wanting to make cool looking designs without putting much thought into our backend data model. Members of the team responsible for our backend design got caught up in schoolwork, causing the design team to develop our frontend design before we had any real idea of what our data would be formatted like. This synchonization error, coupled with the deep desire to just create cool looking designs brought about many issues when it came to actually developing the application in code.</p>
  <p>If I was to do things differently, I would have had our team jointly design the front and backend models before moving forward with any real designs. We would have a data-up model, where we design our frontend components based on the backend database schema. This would allow us our frontend to communicate with our backend much more seamlessly and without any formatting conflicts. Perhaps if our application had a much simple data model, we would have been able to take the same UI down model of design.</p>
